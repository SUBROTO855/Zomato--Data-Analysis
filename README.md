# Zomato--Data-Analysis
## Summary
This project is a part of Coding Ninjas Course: Data Science & Machine Learning. In this project, I have used my learning to solve the questions which were asked with the help of python packages such as numpy, matplot, pandas and APIs of Zomato. The dataset I have used was provided by Coding Ninjas.
